- **JWT & OTP are here!**

  authenticus has now built-in support for [JSON Web Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) and [One-Time Passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password).

## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/boywithkeyboard/authenticus/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

- **v3 is a complete rewrite** and makes authenticus even easier to use. The library is now more type-safe and it's easier than ever to get started with authenticus.

- **We dropped support for less popular providers.** This version removes support for *GitLab*, *LinkedIn* and *Twitch* to focus more on the most crucial ones.

  *I mean, honestly, who uses them anyway?*
